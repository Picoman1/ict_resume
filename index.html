          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">A highly motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science Engineering graduate, having
            completed my degree with
            first-class honors in the 2020-2024 academic period. During my tenure as the General Secretary of the
            college, I
            honed my leadership, communication, and organizational skills, effectively managing various events and
            initiatives.
            My strong problem-solving abilities are complemented by hands-on experience in developing and executing
            multiple projects, demonstrating proficiency in technical concepts and teamwork.Currently seeking a
            challenging
            position where I can leverage my skills in software development, project management, and leadership to
            contribute
            to a dynamic and innovative team. </p>

        <ul>
          <h4>Simple Authentication System</h4>
          <li>
            <p class="text-justify">Developed a comprehensive login and signup web application utilizing Node.js,
              Express.js, Mongoose, and
              Handlebars. This project encompassed the creation of a robust backend infrastructure, including secure
              user
              authentication and data management through MongoDB. The integration of Mongoose facilitated seamless
              interaction with the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. To enhance user experience,
              a
              dynamic front end was implemented using Handlebars, providing interactive login and signup forms.
              Rigorous error handling was incorporated to maintain application stability and provide informative
              feedback
              to users. This project effectively demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, with a strong
              emphasis
              on backend architecture, database management, and user interface development.</p>
          </li>
          <h4>Facial Recognition Attendance Marking System</h4>
          <li>
            <p class="text-justify">Constructed a robust facial recognition attendance system using Python, OpenCV, and
              face_recognition
              libraries. The system effectively captures and processes live video feeds to detect and recognize
              pre-enrolled
              individuals. By employing image processing techniques, the system accurately matches faces against a
              database of known individuals. Real-time attendance data, including names and timestamps, is meticulously
              recorded into a CSV file for comprehensive record-keeping. This project showcases a strong foundation in
              computer vision, image processing, and data management, demonstrating the ability to develop practical,
              data-driven solutions using Python for real-world applications</p>
          </li>
          <h4>Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition System</h4>
          <li>
            <p class="text-justify">Created a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and deep
              learning. Used
              OpenCV for video capture and processing, and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection. Employed
              TensorFlow and Keras to run a pre-trained gesture recognition model, displaying the recognized gestures
              on a live video feed from a webcam. This project highlights skills in combining machine learning with
              realtime video processing.</p>
